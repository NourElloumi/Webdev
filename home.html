<h1> Who we are : </h1>
<p> Call ’n Fix is a web-based system. It is designed for everyone who requires maintenance, and
for those who are unemployed and looking for a job. It is an organized site with different
types of users. The system interfaces with many other systems: the browsers used by both the
customers and the workers, the GPS system (to locate nearby workers). </p>
<br><br>
<h1> What we offer : </h1>
<p> The call ‘n fix website allows <b> customers </b> to register and create accounts as clients. Upon
logging into the CnF, the website provides the functionality of searching for particular
services, sorting them by different filters, accessing all contact information and ratings of
those workers, leaving comments and ratings, seeing your search history. <br>
for the <b> workers </b>, you can also create an account and login as a worker. Besides allowing the
same functionalities as the customers, the system allows the functionality of typing additional
information (the type of service you will be giving and your location). After that, the system
sends you an email every time a client checks out your profile. Each time the work is done,
the client can rate his satisfaction with the work. </p>
